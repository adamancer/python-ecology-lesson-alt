## About Python

Python is a high-level, general purpose language. In practical terms,
that means it dispenses with many of the complexities of writing code.
It is widely used and has an active community of developers, making it
suitable for a large number of tasks.

A core philosophical tenet of Python is that code is read more often
than it is written. Best practices for coding in Python therefore
emphasize writing well-documented, consistently formatted code that
follows language-wide standards. **In a Pythonic world, everyone's code
would look the same.**

One feature to be aware of going in is that Python uses whitespace (as
opposed to braces) to organize blocks of code. This can be a sticking
point for people used to other languages.

## Getting started

Everything in Python is an *object*. Each object has a type, which
controls what the object can do. For example, we can add integers
together or append a string to a list. An object can be *assigned* to a
*variable*, and a *function* performs an action.

Python is an *object-oriented language*. This means that each object
includes built-in variables and functions that can be used from the
object itself. When working from an object, we use different terms to
refer to these concepts:

-   an *attribute* stores a piece of data
-   a *method* performs an action

Let's look at one of the main built-in types, `str`, to see how this
works in practice. In Python, `str`, short for string, is used to store
and manipulate text. To get started, we'll assign the string "hello
world" to the variable **text**. In Python, we use a single equal sign
for assignment and quotes to create a string.

::: callout ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Using quotes

Either single or double quotes can be used to create strings, but try to
use them consistently! We will use double quotes in the examples here.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

First we'll define a variable called text. Variables can be any type of
object supported by Python, but in this case we'll use a string:

```python
text = "hello world"
```

Now, instead of retyping the full string every time we need it, we can
access that string by referring to the variable:

```python
text
```

```{.output}
'hello world'
```

We can check the type of the variable using the `type()` function:

```python
type(text)
```

```{.output}
str
```

We can modify the text by calling one of the methods built into the
`str` class. We call methods by appending a period and the name of the
method to the object. For example, to display the string in upper case,
use `upper()`:

```python
text.upper()
```

```{.output}
'HELLO WORLD'
```

After running a cell, Jupyter displays a representation of the object
that appears in the last line of a cell (but note that some actions,
like assigning an object, have no output). Some cells will have more
than one line, and it is often useful to display content produced
earlier in a cell. This can be accomplished using the built-in `print()`
function. In the cell below, we'll use `print()` to show a series of
strings:

```python
"hello"
print("h")
print("e")
print("l")
print("l")
print("o")
"world"
```

```{.output}
h
e
l
l
o

'world'
```

Note that the string "hello" at the top of the cell lacks a print
statement and does not appear in the output, whereas the text "world"
*does* appear in the output because it is the last line of the cell.

Each object may contain many attributes and methods. Use the `help()`
function on any object, including functions or methods, to show a
description of the object and list the available methods.

```python
help(str)
```

```{.output}

 |          Translation table, which must be a mapping of Unicode ordinals to
 |          Unicode ordinals, strings, or None.
 |      
 |      The table must implement lookup/indexing via __getitem__, for instance a

 |      left untouched.  Characters mapped to None are deleted.
 |  
 |  upper(self, /)
 |      Return a copy of the string converted to uppercase.
 |  
 |  zfill(self, width, /)

 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
 |

 |      
 |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
 |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
 |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
 |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

### Data types

Python also includes data types for representing other types of data,
including numbers or collections of data. The core Python data types are
introduced in the table below. We'll talk more about some of these as we
encounter them in the lesson:

## Libraries

Python includes a number of [built-in
functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that are
available wherever Python is installed. See the table below for some
examples.

Python also includes a number of built-in libraries. A *library* bundles
functions and other code related to a single task or data type. They are
used to simplify the performance of common tasks. By using a common code
base, a library allows coders to work more quickly and with fewer
errors.

The libraries built into Python are referred to as the [Python Standard
Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). They can be
accessed through a typical Python installation and do not require any
additional downloads. A few examples are included in the table below,
but as with the table of built-in functions, there are more where those
came from.

### Examples from the Python Standard Library

  [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)   Reads, writes, and analyzes dates
                                                                and times

  [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)               Create, manipulate, and get
                                                                information about files and paths

  [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)       Generate pseudo-random numbers

## Documentation

The documentation for each library can be viewed by clicking the link in
the table. Documentation is an invaluable resource. It provides
descriptions of what a library does and detailed information about how
it can be used, often including examples.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Unlike the built-in functions, we must import a library before we can
use it. We do so using the `import` statement:

```python
import datetime
```

Once imported, the library is available for use anywhere in the current
document. When using a library, we must include the name of the library
to access its functions. For example, to create a `datetime.date` object
(that is, a `date` object defined by the `datetime` library), we include
both the library and method name:

```python
date = datetime.date(1970, 1, 1)
```

As with the built-in types, the `datetime.date` object includes its own
suite of attributes and methods. We can, for example, use the year
attribute to get the year:

```python
date.year
```

```{.output}
1970
```

Or convert the date to a string using the
[`strftime()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime)
method and [date format
codes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).
Here, %Y corresponds to YYYY, %m to MM, and %d to DD.

```python
date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```

```{.output}
'1970-01-01'
```

Like Python itself, the Python Standard Library is maintained by the
Python Software Foundation. The built-in libraries are limited to a
relatively small set of operations expected to be useful to a broad
population of users. However, Python allows users to create their own
libraries to perform actions that are beyond the scope of core Python.
The rest of this lesson will focus on an external library called pandas.

::: keypoints ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

-   Python is a widely used language that can be used for a variety of
    tasks, including analyzing data
-   Python uses different data types to handle text, numbers,
    collections, and other kinds of data
-   Assign values to variables using the `=` operator
-   Use functions and methods to perform specific actions
-   Python's functionality can be extended using libraries, including
    libraries written by members of the community that address
    discipline-specific needs
-   Use the `help()` function and developer documentation to learn more
    about Python and Python libraries
