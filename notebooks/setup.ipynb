    "\n",
    "This lesson uses Python to analyze and visualize data from an ecology dataset. It was adapted (and currently includes huge chunks of text lifted directly from) [Data Management with SQL for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) and covers similar material to [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). The idea was to create parallel lessons for SQL and Python for use by the Smithsonian Carpentries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is designed to use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive development environment widely used for doing data science with Python. **The rest of this page provides instructions for setting up the software and data needed to complete this lesson. Please complete setup prior to your scheduled lesson.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Download the appropriate [VS Code installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your system. Most people should click the big blue button for their operating system.\n",

We **strongly recommend** sticking to the installation instructions and software presented here for this lesson. The Anaconda distribution includes additional programs that may affect the output of some of the code presented in this lesson, which can be confusing for people new to Python. "

A CLI is an application that runs commands that are provided as text. Examples of command-line interfaces include the Windows command prompt and Unix shells, including bash. We'll be using the CLI to install and run JupyterLab.\n",

    "- **Windows:** Use the Miniforge Prompt, which was installed as part of Miniforge. You can find it by searching for Miniforge Prompt in the search box on the Windows toolbar.\n",
    "- **macOS:** Use the Terminal. You can find it in the Applications/Utilities folder or by searching for Terminal using Spotlight.\n",
