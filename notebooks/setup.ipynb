    "This lesson uses Python to analyze and visualize data from an ecology dataset. It was adapted (and currently includes huge chunks of text lifted directly from) [Data Management with SQL for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) and covers similar material to [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). The idea was to create parallel lessons for SQL and Python for use by the Smithsonian Carpentries.\n",
