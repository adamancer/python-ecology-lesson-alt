    "## Why use pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Data Analysis Library, or pandas, is a Python library used to work with dataframes. A dataframe is a representation of tabular data very similar to a spreadsheet, consisting of rows (representing records) and columns (representing fields or variables). It is a very common format for representing scientific data and is likely to be very familiar to anyone taking this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas offers the same advantages as any well-written library: It creates a common codebase for working on a single task, in this case, analyzing data. Some benefits of this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability:** Provides flexible, well-tested methods for reading, querying, aggregating, grouping, and plotting data\n",
    "- **Repeatability:** Repeat the same analyses when data is added or changed\n",
    "- **Speed:** Faster in many cases than coding our own functions in Python\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** Document and share code in narrative form using tools like Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- **Community:** Access a large, active community for help when we run into problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing data using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the libraries in the Python Standard Library discussed in the previous lesson, pandas is not part of the typical Python installation. Once it has been installed, however, it can be accessed using the same `import` command used to import the built-in libraries. By convention, pandas is imported using the alias \"pd\". We can assign the alias using the `as` keyword:"

But it's also a matter of consistency with the larger community. Many of the core scientific Python libraries, including pandas, recommend a specific alias, so most code shared online will use those aliases as well."
