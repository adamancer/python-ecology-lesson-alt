title: Setup
---

This lesson uses JupyterLab and pandas to analyze and visualize data
from an ecology dataset. It was adapted (and currently includes huge
chunks of text lifted directly from) [Data Management with SQL for
Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) and covers
similar material to [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for
Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). The idea
was to create parallel lessons for SQL and Python for use by the
Smithsonian Carpentries.

This lesson is designed to use JupyterLab, an interactive development
environment widely used for doing data science with Python. **The rest
of this page provides instructions for setting up the software and data
needed to complete this lesson. Please complete the setup prior to your
scheduled lesson.**

## Setup

We will use a program called Miniconda to set up JupyterLab, so first we
need to download and install [Miniconda (64
bit)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links).
We recommend using the following installers:

-   **Windows**: Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit
-   **macOS**:
    -   **Apple M1:** Miniconda3 macOS Apple M1 64-bit pkg
    -   **Intel:** Miniconda3 macOS Intel x86 64-bit pkg

### Using the command-line interface

A command-line interface, or CLI, is an application that can run
commands supplied as text. Examples of command-line interfaces include
the Windows command prompt and Unix shells, including bash. We'll be
using the CLI to install and run JupyterLab.

Each operating system has one or more command-line interfaces available.
We recommend using the following applications for this lesson:

-   **Windows:** Use the Anaconda Prompt, which was installed as part of
    Miniconda. You can find it by searching for Anaconda Prompt in the
    search box on the Windows toolbar.
-   **macOS:** Use the Terminal. You can find it in the
    Applications/Utilities folder or by searching for Terminal using
    Spotlight.

The commands given below may not work if a different application is
used, so we'd strongly encourage you to use the recommended ones.

#### Running commands

To run any of the commands presented here, copy-paste them into the CLI,
then press enter to run the command.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Installing JupyterLab

Once the command-line interface is open, run the following commands to
install the software needed for this course:

    conda create --name python-ecology-lesson
    conda activate python-ecology-lesson
    conda install --channel conda-forge --yes altair jupyterlab pandas

### Downloading data to the lesson folder

Next we'll create the lesson folder and download the data needed for the
lesson:

1.  Create a folder called **python-ecology-lesson** on your desktop
2.  Create a folder called **data** inside the folder created in step 1
3.  Download the following files into the data folder:
    -   surveys.csv: https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/10717177
    -   species.csv: https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/3299483

Alternatively, we can run the following commands to create the lesson
folders and download the necessary data:

    cd ~/Desktop
    mkdir python-ecology-lesson/data
    cd python-ecology-lesson/data
    wget -O surveys.csv https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/10717177
    wget -O species.csv https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/3299483

::: callout ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Note for Windows users

The commands used here assume that your desktop is in a standard
location. If you are using a Windows computer with OneDrive enabled,
your desktop may be in a different place. You can use the following
command in place of `cd ~/Desktop` in the instructions on this page to
get to your desktop no matter where it is:

```powershell
cd $([Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop"))
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Running JupyterLab

Once JupyterLab has been installed, we can run it by opening the
command-line interface and running the following commands:

    conda activate python-ecology-lesson
    cd ~/Desktop
    cd python-ecology-lesson
    jupyter-lab

JupyterLab should now open in a new browser window.

### Test your installation

Try running this command before the scheduled lesson -- does JupyterLab
appear as expected?
